## Color Classifier

Train the color classifier in your local machine yourself. This color classifier methodology takes supervised learning path to make the color classifier better as many inputs as you give to the computer. In other words, you train the color classifier yourself by teaching it how the colors look like. In this code, you are supposed to give inputs to the model by selecting the right color as the colors pop up, that information is taken through layers and weights get adjusted. That eventually trains the model.

### Getting the code

First clone or download the repository to your local machine and install all the dependencies by running the following code.

```
git clone https://github.com/velansalis/xp_MachineLearning
cd xp_MachineLearning/Tensorflow.js/Color-Classifier
npm install
```

Then train the data by running

```
npm run train
```

The output will be visible in the port 3000. Go to the browser, hit the address http://localhost:3000 and see this in action.
