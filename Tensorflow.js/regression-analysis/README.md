## Regression-Analysis

Regression analysis models with Tensorflow.js. In statistical modeling, **Regression Analysis** is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among variables. It includes many techniques for modeling and analyzing several variables, when the focus is on the relationship between a [dependent variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_variable "Dependent variable") and one or more [independent variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_variable "Independent variable") (or 'predictors').
