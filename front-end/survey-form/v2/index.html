        <p id="description">
            The word anime is the Japanese term for animation, which means all forms of animated media. Outside
            Japan, anime refers specifically to animation from Japan or as a Japanese-disseminated animation style
            often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.
