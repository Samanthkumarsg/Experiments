                    Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland in 1969. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils
                    Torvalds, and the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds. Both of his
                    parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the
                    Swedish-speaking minority. Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American
                    chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted
                    as
                    saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this
                    makes
                    him half "Nobel Prize–winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".
